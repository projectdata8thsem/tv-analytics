<h3><strong>TV Analytics</strong><br>
By Shubhanshu Yadav</h3><br>
In order to test the website using the flask development server first execute setyp.py (sets up the python virtual evironment) and then run.py <br>
Once the server is running go to localhost:5000 or localhost:5000/searchSeries<br>
Enter the name of a TV show in the text box. <br>
If you entered a show that you have not searched for before a webcrawler will collect all the information about the TV series you entered (this may take some time). Otherwise the information previously stored is used.<br>
Now you will be shown a graph that plots the ratings of all the episodes of the TV show. <br>
The points in the graph are colour coded by season.<br>
Some information about an episode can be viewed by placing the mouse over the respective point in the graph. <br>
Clicking on the point redirects you to a webpage containing the links where the episode can be watched online.<br>
